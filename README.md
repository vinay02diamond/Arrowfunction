# Arrowfunction
This repository contains examples of different ways to define and use functions in JavaScript. This project focuses on demonstrating various methods of defining functions, including traditional function expressions, arrow functions, and const-based function expressions.
Introduction
The primary goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of different approaches to defining functions in JavaScript. The examples include:

Traditional function expressions

Const-based function expressions

Arrow functions with curly braces

Simplified single-line arrow functions

Features
Clear and organized examples of various function definitions

Easy-to-understand code snippets

Demonstrates the use of console logs for output

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd ArrowFunctionDemo
Usage
To run the examples, open the index.js file in your preferred code editor and execute the code using Node.jsor your browser's developer console.

Here's a brief description of each example:

Traditional Function Expression:

javascript
function demo() {
    console.log("hello");
}
demo();
Const-based Function Expression:

javascript
const demo = function demo() { 
    console.log("hello");
}
demo();
Arrow Function with Curly Braces:

javascript
const demo = () => {
    console.log("hello");
}
demo();
Simplified Single-line Arrow Function:

javascript
const demo = () => console.log("hello");
demo();
